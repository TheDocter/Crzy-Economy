# About
------
Crzy Economy is a full blown economy for your chat. As of version 1.0.0 It only contains banking, checking and savings, and
wire transfers. Version 1.5.0 will introduce a job system where users can earn currency bi-weekly, monthly, etc.
Version 2.0.0 will contain stores where users will be able to spend their currency on fictional items. The
items will eventually be used for Crzy Royale in Version 2.5.0. Version 3.0.0 will introduce simulated stock markets based
off of a database and random up and downs. Version 3.5.0 will introduce IRA/Retirement systems.

# Setup
-------
1. Install Script via Stream Labs Chat bot.
2. Customize settings.
3. Tell your users about it.

# Banking
---------
Banking is the easiest part of the script to use. The following commands are pretty much straight forward.

!bankinfo - This will display your banks name along with commands to be used with it.

!createchecking - This will allow the user to create a checking account (This is in the form of a text file).

!depositchecking - This will allow the user to deposit their currency into the checking account.

!createsavings - This will allow the user to create a savings account (This is in the form of a text file).

!depositsavings - This will allow the the user to deposit their currency into the savings account.

!wiretransfer - This will allow the user to transfer currency from them self to a user they specify with the amount they specify.


# WARNINGS
----------
If you modify any of the files, I will not support the plugin for you. As this plugin contains many different parts. Unless I tell
you to modify a file please do not modify the files here. Many of the files are connected and will most likely break if you
modify something wrong.

# Support
----------
As I only use the Stream Labs Chat bot discord once in a while, usually when I go live or I have a question, The best place
to reach me is my personal discord server.

# Help ME!
The following is a complaint about Stream Labs Chat Bot GetAPI Function and how I had to get Crzy Giphy working correctly.
Help me get the developers of Stream Labs Chatbot add in a correct api read function for json! As of right now it returns UNICODE, yes a goddamn unicode string!
Please login to their site and up vote that was turned down by AnkhHeart saying there is no need for it. WHICH IF LOOK AT HOW I HAD TO GET IT TO LOAD
IT IS NEEDED!!! To much code needed to correct the issue. Wasteful!
