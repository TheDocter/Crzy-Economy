Help me get the developers of Stream Labs Chatbot add in a correct apiread function! As of right now it returns UNICODE, yes a goddamn unicode string! 
Please login to their site and upvote that was turned down by AnkhHeart saying there is no need for it. WHICH IF LOOK AT HOW I HAD TO GET IT TO LOAD 
IT IS NEEDED!!! To much code needed to correct the issue. Wasteful!

[Request for JSON ReadAPI function instead of getting a god damn unicode string!](https://ideas.streamlabs.com/ideas/SL-I-3215)
